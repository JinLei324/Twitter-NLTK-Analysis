    "### About this project\n",
    "This is your mid-semester project. You are allowed to work with a partner (if you'd like). Only one partner (or max two per group is allowed). The goal of this mid-semester project is to work with Twitter API to analyze tweets from a person, and in this case, President Donald Trump.  @RealDonaldTrump tweets provide a great opportunity to understand how online media can be used to communicate over the traditional media. Moreoover, Trump tweets has become so consequential, they actually can move the stock market on short term and get network TV to debate and discuss hours and hours about what Trump meant.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope this project will be fun as we can analyze range of emotions, hope, controversy, vagueness that are part of Trump tweets. We are interested in seeing what conclusions you can draw from US Presidents tweets. \n",
    "* DISCLAIMER: This project is not designed with any bias in mind. Note that we could pick either candiadate (Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump) or anyone else to do the same analysis. We hope your analysis is objective, independent of any political bias you may have. As Data Scientists, it is our responsiblity to do independent analysis of the data we try to understand. You should follow data and interpret w/o any bias.\n"

    "3. [Create a Twitter developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply/) by clicking the 'Apply' button on the top right of the page. Attach it to your Twitter account. You'll have to fill out a form describing what you want to do with the developer account. Explain that you are doing this for a class at Rutgers University and that you don't know exactly what you're building yet and just need the account to get started. These applications are approved by some sort of AI system, so it doesn't matter exactly what you write. Just don't enter a bunch of alweiofalwiuhflawiuehflawuihflaiwhfe type stuff or you might get rejected.\n",
    "4. Once you're logged into your developer account, [create an application for this assignment](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new).  You can call it whatever you want, and you can write any URL when it asks for a web site.  You don't need to provide a callback URL.\n",
    "5. On the page for that application, find your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret.\n",
    "6. On the same page, create an Access Token.  Record the resulting Access Token and Access Token Secret.\n",
    "7. Edit the file [keys.json](keys.json) and replace the placeholders with your keys."

    "According to [this Verge article](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15103504/donald-trump-iphone-using-switched-android), Donald Trump switched from an Android to an iPhone sometime in March 2017.\n",

    "Use this data along with the seaborn `distplot` function to examine the distribution over hours of the day in eastern time that trump tweets on each device for the 2 most commonly used devices.  Your plot should look somewhat similar to the following. \n",
    "\n",
    "During the campaign, it was theorized that Donald Trump's tweets from Android were written by him personally, and the tweets from iPhone were from his staff. Does your figure give support the theory?\n",
    "\n",
    "Response: In 2016, the time allocation for the usage of the iphone centered in the afternoon, while his tweets from 2015 to present shows that he mostly tweets in the morning. It seems that the tweets from iphone in 2016 were from his staff, not himself."

    "It turns out that we can use the words in Trump's tweets to calculate a measure of the sentiment of the tweet. For example, the sentence \"I love America!\" has positive sentiment, whereas the sentence \"I hate taxes!\" has a negative sentiment.

    "A look at the top words used and the sentiments expressed in Trump tweets indicates that, some words are used with others almost all the time. A notable example is the slogan like Make America Great Again. As such, it may be beneficial to look at groups of words rather than individual words. For that, we will look at an approach applying a Principal Component Analysis. \n",

    "### The PCA\n",
    "The Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, is a tool generally used to identify patterns and to reduce the number of variables you have to consider in your analysis. For example, if you have data with 200 columns, it may be that a significant amount of the variance in your data can be explained by just 100 principal components. In the PCA, the first component is chosen in such a way that has the largest variance, subsequent components are orthogonal and continue covering as much variance as possible. In this way, the PCA samples as much of the variability in the data set with the first few components. Mathematically, each component is a linear combination of all the input parameters times coefficients specific for that component. These coefficients, or loading factors, are constrained such that the sum of the squares of them are equal to 1. As such, the loading factors serve as weights describing how strongly certain parameters contribute to the specific principal component. Parameters with large values of positive or negative loading factors are correlated with each other, which can serve to identify trends in your data."

You can start with the top 50 words, but full analysis may require large number of words.\n",

The values of the matrix is how often the word appears. Apply the techniques we learned to reduce the weight of most common words (if necessary). Since this is a sparse matrix, you can use the sparse martix libraries to make things a bit more efficient (we can also use a regular numpy arrays to store these things since the dimensions are not too large).
